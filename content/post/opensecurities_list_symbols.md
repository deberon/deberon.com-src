One more day, one more [OpenSecurities](https://github.com/opensecurities) update. This is an incremental update to the stocks.py script. I added an option that pulls a list of stock symbols from the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. This was a very straightforward task considering the NASDAQ website provides the company list in comma separated value (CSV) format.

The data is generously provided by [NASDAQ](http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/companies-by-name.aspx)
